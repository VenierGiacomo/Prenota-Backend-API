## About the project
Through our mobile apps ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1523525291) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.prenota.client)) and our [website](https://prenota.cc), users can book and pay services in their city in a few seconds.

The services offered range from hairdressers and beauty salons to sports structures and medical services. Additional categories, such as public transportation and tax consulting services, will be added.

#### To the small businesses offering the services, we provide an easy-to-use online calendar personalized on their needs and business category.
#### This calendar includes a customer database and some analytics on their business performance.

Their calendar is connected to our mobile apps and website, so users can only book in the available time slots, without the need to wait for a confirmation.
